# nlp-drug-labeling
This repository contains the code for my NCTR summer student research project. My project is annotating adverse reactions in drug reactions using an AI model. 
The data used is from [Adverse Drug Reaction Extraction from Drug Labels](https://bionlp.nlm.nih.gov/tac2017adversereactions/).
`data processing.py` contains the code for processing the XML files into a form that is used by the model.
